# model-a-day
A collection of 3D models created for free use as part of the model-a-day challenge, may or may not add models every day.

## Contributing:

Try to include the following with every model:
- `.blend` file
- `.png` file (1280x800) image of the rendered model
- `.stl` file, allowing online previewing
- `.fbx` file, for use in UE4

with the same prefix for each file.

Put each model's files in their own folder dedicated to the file for that model.  Use PascalCase for all folder and file names.

### Example:

- `Example/Example.blend`, `Example/Example.png`, `Example/Example.stl`, `Example/Example.fbx`

Feel free to use as many subfolders as possible to distinguish groups of models.
