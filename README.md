# model-a-day
A collection of 3D models created for free use as part of the model-a-day challenge, may or may not add models every day.

## Contributing:

Try to include the following with every model:
- `.blend` file
- `.png` file image preview of the rendered model
- `.stl` file, allowing online previewing

with the same prefix for each file.

### Example:

- `example.blend`, `example.png`, `example.stl`

Feel free to use as many subfolders as possible to distinguish groups of models.
